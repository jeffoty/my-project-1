PROJECT OWNER: JEFF ODHIAMBO.

PROJECT NAME: CREATING A BOOK LIBRARY.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Being able to look for a book and be able to read it for free without having to subscribe to various sites such as amazon books will make it expensive for students to get access to books and utilize them.

SOLUTION

By creating a website that allows you to freely access books available to the public. It solves the problem of students spending a lot of cash just to purchase books. Free access to information was the end goal of my project.
